# Interpreting Predictions of NLP Models

The tutorial will be held on Thursday, November 19th, 2020 at 15:00 UTC time (7:00 pacific, 10:00 eastern) on Zoom. Videos will be available after the tutorial. The presenters are [Eric Wallace](http://ericswallace.com/), [Matt Gardner](https://matt-gardner.github.io/), and [Sameer Singh](https://sameersingh.org/).

### Abstract
Although neural NLP models are highly expressive and empirically successful, they also systematically fail in counterintuitive ways and are opaque in their decision-making process. This tutorial will provide a background on interpretation techniques, i.e., methods for explaining the predictions of NLP models. We will first situate example-specific interpretations in the context of other ways to understand models (e.g., probing, dataset analyses). Next, we will present a thorough study of example-specific interpretations, including saliency maps, input perturbations (e.g., LIME, input reduction), adversarial attacks, and influence functions. Alongside these descriptions, we will walk through source code that creates and visualizes interpretations for a diverse set of NLP tasks. Finally, we will discuss open problems in the field, e.g., evaluating, extending, and improving interpretation methods.
